Spec
====

We are a community management company.
We have several users and several clients.
We need a webplatform to setup automatic tweeting.
Each user wants to:
- be able to save tweet templates
- plan new tweets to be tweeted with the account of a client at
  a specific time
- having recurring tweets
- see statistics of their previous tweets for each client

Technology required:
- React for the web interface
- a database (MySQL preferred)
- using the official Twitter API
- anything else up to your discretion
